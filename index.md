#  Moopsy,Jaanaki And Kamala Story

***There  is a fox named kamala  and her friend was Moopsy.***

*One day they read an artical about a chocolate mine on top of the mountain near an oasis in dolphinium 5, which is part of the Kamala island.*

*They decided to go to doliphinium 5 and called their friend Janiki bos to join them.*

*The canal connecting directly to go to dolphinium 5 was closed that day.*

*Therefor they had to go through kamalaland which is part of Narayan islands.*

*Soon they set out with their mining tools. When they arrived at kamalaland there there was a waterway and a yacht which was getting ready to depart to dolpinium 5.*

*So they bought tickets to dolphinium 5 to go on the yacht and boarded. Halfway through the ride in the channel, Moopsy spotted a blue passageway in one side of the yacht, covered with glass with a layer of water flowing on it.*

*In that passageway Moopsy saw a bike written ECB that stands for "Electronic Churro Bike". There was a mobile system on the bike that was connectes to satelite called KJMC - Kamala Janaki Moopsy Churro. Moospy went to get Kamal Janaki to come and see the bike. When Moopsy came back she saw the bike going down from top layer to the bottom layer and disappear. Therefore Kamala and Janaki could not see it*

*When they arrived at kamala island, there was a free tour bus that was ready to go to dolphimium 5 and they all sat inside the bus.*

*The bus stopped near a lake and waterfall with running water where you can rent all terrain vehicles and they got one. They took the all terrain vehicle and then they went halfway and found a shortcut to the top of the mountain.*

* They decided to park the vehicle and took shortcut to climb to the top. While going up they all saw the bike ECB on top of the mountain. How did it get there is the question.

*When they reached the top, Moopsy first took the ECB and turned the handle, it opened a door in the mountain mine. All of a sudden Kamala and Janaki were pulled into the mine through the door and the door closed.*

and soon they began mining for chocolate which took 1 and a half hours.*

*When they were done mining, they found chocolate and gold ore in a box formation.*

*Also found the golden churro logo and churro logo stamp which came with a churro logo stamp pad in fact all of them came in a box.*

*They picked up all these and then they left the mine. After they were down the mountain they heard a gurgle from the mountain.*

*Shortly after that, the waterfall and lake were flooded with gold ore mixed with chocolate churro logo and churro logo stamp.*

like the mountain they fell from in the chocolate wow they all said they wrote a book next to the chocolate mine about their adventure when they got home they published it everyone read it the end.
