#  Moopsy And Kamala Story

**There  is a fox named kamala  and her friend was Moopsy.**

*One day they read an artical about a chocolate mine near an oasis dolphinium 5, which is part of the Kamala islands.*

*They decided to go to doliphimium 5 and called their friend Janiki bos to join them.*

*The canal connecting directly to go to dolphinium 5 was closed that day.*

*Therefor they had to go through kamalaland which is part of Narayan islands.*

*Soon they set out with their mining tools. When they arrived at kamalaland there there was a waterway and a boat which was getting ready to depart to dolpinium 5*

*So they bought boat tickets to dolphinium 5 and boarded. When they arrived there was a free tour bus that was ready to go to dolphimium 5 and they all sat  inside the bus.*

a lake and waterfall with running water then they climbed to the top of the mountain soon they began mining for chocolate which took 1 and a half hours when they were done they cracked a chocolate bar
and found the golden churro logo and churro logo stamp which came with a churro logo stamp pad in fact all of them came with the churro logo and churro logo stamp then they left the mine after they were down the mountain they heard a gurgle from the mountain shortly after the waterfall and lake were flooded with the churro logo and churro logo stamp making shapes like the mountain they fell from in the chocolate wow they all said they wrote a book next to the chocolate mine about their adventure when they got home they published it everyone read it the end.
