## Machine Learning and Deep Learning 

### Deep Learning based drone detection - YOLOv4

Description: Developed deep learning based drone detection system that able to detect any flying drone in live. I have used You only look once (YOLOv4) object detection framework to implement this project. I have trained 6000 imgaes (4000 was manually labelled by labelimg tools) to traine this model and tested in live environment.

### Flower Classifier with pretrained VGG16 and CIFAR10 by ResNET20

**Description**

- VGGNET16: Developed a flower classifier using VGG16. Other tools I used keras and some machine learning concept such as Activation, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, Flattening, EarlyStopping etc.

- ResNET20: Implemented CIFAR10 classifier using ResNet20 including machine leanring tools/ technology such as TensorFlow, optimizers, BatchNormalization, AveragePooling2D, ZeroPadding2D etc.
